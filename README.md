# Machine Learning Classification Models

This repository contains implementations of various classification algorithms applied to different datasets, demonstrating model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation techniques.

## Projects

### Wine Classification Analysis
- **File**: `wine_classification_analysis.ipynb`
- **Description**: Classification of wine samples into different varieties based on chemical attributes.
- **Techniques**: k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Decision Trees, Random Forests, Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Outcomes**: Achieved 96% classification accuracy with optimal hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.

### Error Classification with XGBoost
- **File**: `error_classification_xgboost.ipynb`
- **Description**: Binary classification model to predict errors in manufacturing processes.
- **Techniques**: Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, GridSearchCV, ROC/AUC Analysis
- **Outcomes**: Improved model accuracy from 77% to 87% through systematic hyperparameter optimization.
